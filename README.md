# Next Gen DAO Project

Welcome to the Next Gen DAO Project, a comprehensive demonstration of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) built using Hardhat, Solidity, and React. This project showcases a complete workflow from smart contract development and deployment to frontend integration and testing.

## Project Overview

This project includes:

- **Smart Contracts**: Developed in Solidity, including a DAO contract and an ERC-20 token contract.
- **Frontend**: Built with React and Bootstrap for a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Deployment Scripts**: Automated deployment using Hardhat.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests using Hardhat and Chai.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm
- Hardhat

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/next-gen-dao.git
   cd next-gen-dao
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Deployment

1. Compile the contracts:
   ```sh
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. Deploy the contracts:
   ```sh
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

### Running the Frontend

1. Start the React development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running Tests

Run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:
```sh
npx hardhat test
```

## Key Features

- **DAO Contract**: Allows users to create and vote on proposals.
- **ERC-20 Token**: Custom token used for voting within the DAO.
- **Frontend Integration**: Interact with the DAO through a user-friendly React interface.
- **Automated Deployment**: Scripts to deploy and seed the blockchain with initial data.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests to ensure the reliability of the smart contracts.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language.
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for responsive design.
- **Ethers.js**: Library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Chai**: Assertion library for testing.
